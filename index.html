                <p>welcome to my slug-site!</p>
            <p>this site is primarily to document all slug happenings. these 
                can be accessed in the slug diary tab that can be seen at the 
                top of the page. also, if you wish to view further slug images 
                the tab slug images links to a page that may be pretty 
                interesting to you, heh. 
            </p>

                but that's the basics of the website, so now let's talk about 
                me. i'm a slug. some might say the best slug. i have a bug best 
                friend, but this site's more about slugs so i'll leave it at that.
                i love music and my favorite song is Tubular Bells.
